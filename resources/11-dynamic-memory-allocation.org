We've seen one way to work with pointers, namely pointing a pointer variable at
another variable that already exists in our system. This requires us to know how
much memory our system will need at the moment our program is compiled. What if
we *don't* know how much memory we'll need at compile-time? How do we get access
to new memory while out program is running?

We can use pointers to get access to a block of *dynamically-allocated memory*
at runtime. Dynamically allocated memory comes from a pool of memory known as
*heap*. Prior to this point, all memory we've working with has been coming from
a pool of memory known as the *stack*.
